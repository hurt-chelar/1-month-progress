# Technical Review

### Day 1 
Today I started working on a simple website clone( Netflix)  using HTML and CSS and watched a few playlist on the web development roadmap and understood front-end and back-end development and the different databases and understood how things fit together( flow of everything) 
understood how the server communicates with browser 
DNS -> how to buy them 
Understood what JSON/XML
understood about web API's like 
i18n
DOM 
XHR
Media querries ( making modern webapps ) 
ECMA Scripts and what it means 
typescript and javascript relation ( Elm & babel ) 
Understood the flow of frameworks and libraries like 
react, angular and what it really means
redwoodjs and vuejs 
Contents of react ( hooks, portal, suspense and and how these connect ) 
State Management and redux relation 
Serverside rendering and client-side rendering 

The following are the things that I learned while making the Netflix clone( emphasis on css )  : 
Using the select tag,and idea of header tag. 
using the svg container to make a copy of icon[ Cloning the logo ] 
Splitting the screen using the idea of grid in css to make 2 parts of the screen.
 how to get the same color using the inspect element, and finding the pixel shift using the inspect element option. 
using hero icons to get similar icons 
understood and implemented normal css along with attributes like 
importing font url 
justify-content 
display flex 
cursor 
 understood and implemented the difference between source and source set. 
Adding shadows using gradients 
implemented z index 

Today I'd spent most of my time on learning and understanding how everything fits together and started off with the website clone. 
I have updated the first page of Netflix in the GitHub repo. 



### Day 2 
 
Today I worked completely on finishing the clone website of Netflix using HTML and  CSS and changed some of the codes that I'd made yesterday as I deleted the images folded and started using the website's own source as the image source.   I've completed the front pages as well as the 4 pages below it, only the Faq Part is remaining( which is taking time to do since I am only using CSS, for the pop-up options, within 3-4 hours I should be able to finish that also ). 
I also spent some time learning and troubleshooting git, since I was having errors while pushing my repo( i had to clone the repo from GitHub again locally and then push it) -> now I have understood the reason and have fixed it. 

The following as the things that I learned and implemented today : 
Displaying images directly from the website being cloned rather than downloading and then referencing it as I'd done while coding yesterday. 
Understanding and implementing viewport meta tag. 
Implementing logo from heroicons
Using gradient to give shadows to an image 
Z-index 
understood how section tag can be used to prevent code from being rewritten and its advantages over div 
Learned to display videos in websites and also how to use loop and other functionalities 
Using the idea of input and labels to simulate drop-down column.
understood when + and ~ is used while declaring in the css
how to remove the underline from hyperlink 
the working of border-radius and padding and how it together is implemented in making containers 
learned about inset in css 
things like font weight and why rem is used instead of px 
use of grid and grid template 
use of transition while on click with the cursor 
changing the cursor type while hovering the mouse over it. ( pointer event) 
change the position of the text while focused ( along with transition ) 
understood about the different way to call the parent and the child classes. 
how to change the position of the text to the right side in even intervals of a section using the idea of order and nth child 


### Day 3 
Today I finished the Netflix clone that I was building using HTML and CSS( The last page where CSS along with input and label was used to simulate the function of a dropdown box ) and started learning flex box and tailwind CSS. I've started to build a simple website front page using flexbox today( header completed) 

The following are the things that I learned and implemented today :
Referencing the classes with similar names and different suffixes 
Using the input type condition to check if a checkbox is checked or not and to hide the container with condition( using only css) 
 Using the idea of rotation to rotate svg elements along with the transition. 
The difference and implementation between grid and flex. 
Understanding and implementing the idea of media query to have different css features at different display sizes 
To hide the contents using the idea of overflow  and to overlap images using z-index
used lorem to fill text 
Understood and implemented flex properties like flex-start , flex-end , flex-direction , justify-content , flex-wrap and  also made a sample doc implementing this. 
Implemented flex and order
Got to know about google fonts and how it can be implemented to give any font that we want.
Making of pseudo-elements and  animating line transitions on hover of mouse over links 



I am amking a small change
