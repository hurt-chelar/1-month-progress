# Technical Review

### Day 1 
Today I started working on a simple website clone( Netflix)  using HTML and CSS and watched a few playlist on the web development roadmap and understood front-end and back-end development and the different databases and understood how things fit together( flow of everything) 
understood how the server communicates with browser 
DNS -> how to buy them 
Understood what JSON/XML
understood about web API's like 
i18n
DOM 
XHR
Media querries ( making modern webapps ) 
ECMA Scripts and what it means 
typescript and javascript relation ( Elm & babel ) 
Understood the flow of frameworks and libraries like 
react, angular and what it really means
redwoodjs and vuejs 
Contents of react ( hooks, portal, suspense and and how these connect ) 
State Management and redux relation 
Serverside rendering and client-side rendering 

The following are the things that I learned while making the Netflix clone( emphasis on css )  : 
Using the select tag,and idea of header tag. 
using the svg container to make a copy of icon[ Cloning the logo ] 
Splitting the screen using the idea of grid in css to make 2 parts of the screen.
 how to get the same color using the inspect element, and finding the pixel shift using the inspect element option. 
using hero icons to get similar icons 
understood and implemented normal css along with attributes like 
importing font url 
justify-content 
display flex 
cursor 
 understood and implemented the difference between source and source set. 
Adding shadows using gradients 
implemented z index 

Today I'd spent most of my time on learning and understanding how everything fits together and started off with the website clone. 
I have updated the first page of Netflix in the GitHub repo.
